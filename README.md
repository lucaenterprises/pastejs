# pastejs
Basic self-hosted pastebin alternative made with NodeJS

## How to host
This application can be setup with 3 simple steps.

### Step One: Configure the configuration file
For this, you're going to need an open port on your system, a MongoDB database and an Auth0 account.<br>
Fill in the details in the **config.example.json** file, they're pretty self explanatory.
Once you've filled it in, rename the file to **config.json**

### Step Two: Install the packages
You need to run one command. Think you can handle it? Give it a go now.

> npm install

You can even copy and paste it if you need to.

### Step Three: Start the application
Another command. This is the easier command to type, though.

> node .

Just like the last one, you can copy and paste it.

### Congratulations! You now have PasteJS running on your system.
